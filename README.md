This is a Jekyll theme created for Aista Ltd, and more specifically [Magic Cloud](https://polterguy.github.io/) to
document our project(s). If you want to use it for your own site, you're welcome to do so under the terms of 
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike version 4, implying you'll have to keep the link to our web site. Below

The theme works perfectly for your GitHub Page, and in fact it was explicitly created to document our
own open source framework [Magic Cloud](https://github.com/polterguy/magic), and the theme is created
with a _"content first"_ approach, implying content over functionality, which of course is important
for a site intended to document an open source framework such as [Magic](https://polterguy.github.io).

## Installation

To use the theme add something resembling the following to your YAML configuration file _"\_config.yml"_.

```
# The next line declares you want to use this theme
remote_theme: polterguy/aista-jekyll

# The next line declares the URL structure of your blog items
permalink: /blog/:title

# Title of your site
title: Title of your site

# Description of your site, or slogan

# Your navigation section. Declares the drop down menu items for your hamburger menu.
nav_sections:
  - name: Section 1
    items:
      - url: /section-1/foo
        name: Foo 1
      - url: /section-1/bar
        name: Foo 2
  - name: Section 2
    items:
      - url: /section-2/
        name: Another foo
```

The `remote_theme` parts needs to be exactly as above, the rest is intended for configuring your site, and include
Google Analytics tracking codes, MWR (_"Most Wanted Response"_, a link on your site being the most important navigation hyperlink),
and navigation sections, etc. The navigation sections becomes a navbar that you can toggle at the top of your page
using a hamburger button. If you don't provide an MWR, and/or a `nav_section`, these elements will not be rendered.

## Usage

The theme is blog aware, assuming you save your blog posts into your _"\_posts"_ folder. To list your blog items, create
a Markdown page and store at your root folder and name it for instance _"blog.md"_, and fill it with the following content.

```markdown
---
layout: blog
permalink: /blog/
---

Some descriptive spiehl here for your blog ...

```

To create a single blog item, create a file called for instance _"2022-01-04-new-documentation-website.md"_ and store it
into your _"\_posts"_ folder and fill it as follows.

```markdown
---
layout: post
author: john doe
---

Bananas are _cool_ because they can be eaten.
```

If you do the above, you can go to your site with the relative URL of `/blog/` to see a list of your blogs.

### Creating custom pages

To create custom pages, you can create a markdown file such as the following and store under for instance
a _"misc"_ folder.

```markdown
---
layout: default
permalink: /about
---

# About our amazingly cool website

This website is like the coolest website in the world, because it features Bananas!
```
